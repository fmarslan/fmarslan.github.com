Hello!
<br/>
  <p>
I am a passionate tech enthusiast navigating the world of technology with excitement. It was in the early 2000s when I took my first steps into coding with a strong interest in Computer Programming during my technical high school years. This initial foray led me into the world of software development, and I discovered my curiosity for exploring new technologies.
    </p>
<p>
Over the course of more than a decade, I have been a part of various projects spanning different industries. From NoSQL and Relational Databases to JavaScript development, CI Tools, and Kubernetes orchestration, I have had the opportunity to delve into a wide spectrum of technologies. Additionally, I have nurtured an interest in AI projects and have gained experience in this domain.
</p>
  <p>
My work in Big Data analysis and processing has contributed to making our projects smarter and more data-centric.
</p>
    <p>
Every new project is an adventure and a learning opportunity for me. As I keep up with the latest innovations in the tech world and share my experiences, I aspire to be part of bigger and more exciting projects.
</p>
      <p>
You can find more about me on my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. I am always open to sharing the excitement of the tech world and collaborating on intriguing projects.
