Hello!

I am a passionate tech enthusiast navigating the world of technology with excitement. It was in the early 2000s when I took my first steps into coding with a strong interest in Computer Programming during my technical high school years. This initial foray led me into the world of software development, and I discovered my curiosity for exploring new technologies.

Over the course of more than a decade, I have been a part of various projects spanning different industries. From NoSQL and Relational Databases to JavaScript development, CI Tools, and Kubernetes orchestration, I have had the opportunity to delve into a wide spectrum of technologies. Additionally, I have nurtured an interest in AI projects and have gained experience in this domain.

My work in Big Data analysis and processing has contributed to making our projects smarter and more data-centric.

Every new project is an adventure and a learning opportunity for me. As I keep up with the latest innovations in the tech world and share my experiences, I aspire to be part of bigger and more exciting projects.

You can find more about me on my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. I am always open to sharing the excitement of the tech world and collaborating on intriguing projects.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a new project, please do not hesitate to get in touch!

Best regards,

Fatih Mehmet ARSLAN
